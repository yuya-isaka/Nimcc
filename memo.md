### Handling Non-Zero Exit Codes in `test.sh`
When an exit code is non-zero, it indicates an error has occurred. In the `test.sh` script, the exit code is stored in the `result` variable and compared with the `expect` variable to assess the outcome. Therefore, it's important to be cautious when using the `-e` option with `#!/bin/bash`. This option makes the script exit immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero exit code). This behavior can prematurely terminate the script if not managed carefully.


### Reasons for Using the `-u` Option with `#!/bin/bash`

The `-u` option is included in the `#!/bin/bash` shebang line to enhance the robustness of shell scripts. This option causes the shell to treat unset variables and parameters other than the special parameters "@" and "*" as an error when performing parameter expansion.

### Debugging with the `-x` Option in `#!/bin/bash`

When debugging bash scripts, it is beneficial to add the `-x` option in the `#!/bin/bash` shebang line. This option enables a trace mode that prints each command before it is executed, along with its expanded arguments.
